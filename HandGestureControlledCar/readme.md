# Hand Gesture Controlled Remote Controlled Car

This is my semester project for the course TFY4190 Instrumentation at NTNU, spring 2021.
The project will consist of a car which is controlled via hand gestures. The operator will use a glove with a microcrontroller, accelerometer and RF transceiver, and the car will consist of motors and related drivers, as well as a microcontroller and an RF transceiver.

## Features to come

- Hand gesture controls for forward, backward and turning motion
- Variable speed control by adjusting the movements of the hand
- Two-way communication between car and controller, enables feedback from the car to an indicator on the glove/controller unit
- System for avoiding crashing of the car (ultrasonic range sensor)
