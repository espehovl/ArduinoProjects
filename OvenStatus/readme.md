# Oven Status Indicator and Logger
Keywords:
  Temperature sensor, Thingspeak, LCD display, WiFi

I will update this readme, but in the meantime, the code is fairly well commented, and should be easy to follow. See the circuit diagram for wiring as well.


## Schematic
Note that the temperature sensor (DS18B20) has been connected to an extension wire; the breadboard is not stuck to the oven.
